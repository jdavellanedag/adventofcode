# Advent of code puzzles

---

Advent of code is a series of small puzzles that can be solved using any language, more info see the [website](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

IÂ´m using those puzzles to practicing new languages or practicing, so you might find really bad code, but itÂ´s how we learn ðŸ˜‰.
